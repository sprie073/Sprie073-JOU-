              <p>It is a sport that is played globally whether the ball that is used is replaced with a sock, a rock, a shoe, a football, and  or a basketball etc. The concept of kicking a spherical object into a net remains the same for everybody, no matter what corner of the world you're from.</p>

              <h2>It helped me realize my passion</h2>
              <p>Through soccer i have been able to realize my passion and what really moves me. It has also strongly helped me decide what career i want to pursue and have. Due to what i consider my healthy obssesion a day doesn't go by that i'm not watching a game or talking about it at the very least. I now aspire to become a sports journalist whether as an analyst on live tv or simply writing a recap for a game or an article on a player or team. </p>
             
              <h3>Stephen Talks Soccer </h3>
           
              <p>In additon to this it has inspired me to kickstart a soccer podcast which i plan on launching very soon. A podcast that revolves strictly around the soccer world.</p>
