            <h1></h1>
            
              <p1>Soccer is such an entertaining sport that requires a lot of athleticism and skill and for that reason i have a lot of appreciation for it.<font size="+1"></
      <br>
           
            <h2>When did my interest in the sport start?</h2>
                  
            <p>My interest for soccer started when i was very young as I both played and watched as often as I could. I started out by watching FC Barcelona a team that is based in Spain and plays in the Spanish soccer league called La Liga Santander.<font size="+1.5"></p>

              <h3> Why FC Barcelona was the team i chose to watch?</h3> 
              
              <p>At this time Barcelona were being coached by Josep Guardiola who is now one of the most highly regarded managers in the sport. He has this stature because of the very attractive style of soccer that he made his teams play with.<font size="+1.5"></

              <h4>What also made me very interested in the sport</h4>
                  
              <p>Not only did the manager of Barcelona at the time really spark my interest in this beautiful sport it was also the commentary which was and continues to be done by two gentleman who go by the names of Ray Hudson and Phil Schoen.One of the reasons why i wanted to study journalism and more specifically sports journalism is because of these two commentators who helped me discover my passion to analyse and discuss the game of football/soccer. <font size="+1"> </

              <h5>Which soccer player inspired me?</h5>
                  
            <p>When i was younger i was deeply inspired but who some claim is the greatest soccer player ever. He goes by the name of Lionel Messi. I started watching him when i was 8 years old and haven't stopped since. He inspired me to play soccer myself and try to emulate his phenomenal footwork.</p>
